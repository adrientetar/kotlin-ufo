**A library to read/write [UFO fonts]**

With this library, one can generate [UFO fonts], which in turn allows using the [fontmake] compiler.

This project is currently in very early stage and cannot be used to make fonts. Only UFO 3 is
supported.

Contributions
-------------

I would like to have help with the following:

- Writing tests: we can port some tests from [fontTools.ufoLib], and perhaps write to a
  [virtual filesystem][jimfs] to keep the tests fast to run.
- Set up continuous integration: to run tests and compute code coverage.
- Adding support to read/write more things (but it would be kinda cool to add tests first ðŸ˜€)

If you want to make a non-trivial contribution, consider coordinating with me and sharing design
details beforehand if applicable. Thanks!
